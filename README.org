* What is Parinfer?
[[http://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer][Take a look at this]]

* Compatibility
*NOTIC*:A list of modes thoses should *NOT* be enabled with parinfer-mode at the same time.
- paredit
- electric-pair-mode
- Auto Pairs
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy][lispy]]
- [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]]
- [[https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode][aggressive-indent-mode]]

These plugins also do auto pairs, conflict with parinfer-mode.

But you can still *install* & *require* these fancy plugins, and use the commands.
* Installation
Available on Melpa(and Melpa Stable) now, I recommand to install with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] .
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package parinfer
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (("C-," . parinfer-toggle-mode)
     ;; You can use other structual edit plugin with parinfer.
     ;; This is an example for Paredit.
     ;; To avoid the conflicts, just bind commands those you want. 
     ;; do NOT enable paredit-mode.
     ("M-r" . paredit-raise-sexp)
     ("M-S" . paredit-split-sexp)
     ("M-J" . paredit-join-sexp)
     ("C-)" . paredit-forward-slurp-sexp)
     ("C-(" . paredit-backward-slurp-sexp)
     ("C-\}" . paredit-forward-barf-sexp)
     ("C-{" . paredit-backward-barf-sexp)
     ;; Other command you may want.
     ("M-j" . parinfer-transpose-sexps)
     ("M-k" . parinfer-reverse-transpose-sexps))
    :init
    ;; Enable Parinfer for Emacs Lisp and Clojure.
    (progn
      (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)))
#+END_SRC

* Toggle Indent and Paren mode.
Use ~parinfer-toggle-mode~.

I recommand to add a keybinding for ~parinfer-toggle-mode~, since it will be used frequently.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key parinfer-mode-map (kbd "C-,") 'parinfer-toggle-mode)
#+END_SRC
When the first time, you switch to Indent Mode, if your code will be modified by parinfer,
You will see a confirm message in minibuffer. Type ~y~ for continue, ~n~ to stay in paren mode.

Use ~parinfer-diff~ to see how parinfer will change the buffer with Ediff.

[[file:images/diff_demo.gif]]

Some keybindings in Ediff:
| Key  | Description                                               |
|------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~q~  | Quit diff.                                                |
| ~b~  | B->A in Ediff, this can apply change to your origin code. |
| ~ra~ | Restore A in Ediff, this can revert change.               |
| ~n~  | Move to next difference.                                  |
| ~p~  | Move to previous difference.                              |

Normally, after indenting the whole buffer with ~C-x h~ ~C-M-\~, you can switch to Indent Mode safely.

* Pretty parens.
Use parinfer dim style for Indent Mode, and rainbow-delimiters for Paren Mode.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Install rainbow-delimiters.
  ;; Do not enable rainbow-delimiters directly, parinfer-mode will handle this.
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters)

  ;; Dim parens for Indent Mode.
  (setq parinfer-indent-mode-dim-close-parens t)  ;; this is enabled by default
#+END_SRC

* Performance & Delay processing.
Parinfer-mode will try idle delay processing on large sexp.

Behaviour can be customized:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;  Defaults.
  (setq parinfer-delay-invoke-threshold 6000) ; If processing range is longer than this, we use delay processing.
  (setq parinfer-delay-invoke-idle 0.3) ; delay idle
#+END_SRC

* Preview cursor scope?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq parinfer-preview-cursor-scope t)  ; default nil
#+END_SRC

* FAQ

** Indent region.
In *Indent* Mode, Mark the lines those you want to shift. Press ~TAB~ or ~>~ to shift rgiht, and ~Shift-TAB~ or ~<~ to shift left.
When you deactive region, parinfer will compute the parens and adjust the indentation.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; default keybindings.
  (define-key parinfer-region-mode-map (kbd ">") 'parinfer-shift-right)
  (define-key parinfer-region-mode-map (kbd "<") 'parinfer-shift-left)
#+END_SRC

** Project status.
I'm already using parinfer-mode for Clojure And Elisp. It should be stable and should work as expected.
If there's any bug or uncomfortable stuff, open an issue please.

** I found command XXX break matched parens!
Please open an issue, I'll have a fix.

** Parinfer-mode toggle indent mode is changing the indentation.
The indentation of code should not be changed by indent mode. When you meet this, your code probably have indentation with *TAB*.

Currently Parinfer can not handle tab indentation, you can change all tab indentation to whitespace for current buffer with ~M-x parinfer-untabify-buffer~.

** Use with Evil?
Attempt to support use with evil directly, works fine for limited test. *WIP*.

If it's not work as your expect, Please open a issue.

[[file:images/evil_demo.gif]]

** Use with Lispy?
It is *WIP* for now. Do not use it in your production.
Following command enable parinfer with lispy. 

Parinfer + Lispy will be an awesome solution for structual editing.
More information will come when it is stable.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Instead of using [ and ] as lispy-forward and lispy-backward.
  (use-package key-seq
    :ensure t
    :init
    (progn
      (key-chord-mode 1)
      (key-seq-define parinfer-mode-map ",." 'parinfer-lispy-forward)
      (key-seq-define parinfer-mode-map ".," 'parinfer-lispy-backward)))

  (use-package lispy
    :ensure t)

  (use-package parinfer
    :ensure t
    :init
    (progn
      (setq parinfer-extensions '(pretty-parens company lispy))
      (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)))
#+END_SRC
*** Trade Off
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (defun hello ()
    |(print 123))

  ;; After you press ( at the cursor`|`
  ;; You have to insert a space before input the code.
  ;; Because in this situation:
  (defun hello ()
    (|(print 123)))

  ;; Lispy's single key command is available.
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Use in REPL?
Not yet, I simply use ~electric-pair-mode~ for auto pairs.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'electric-pair-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Hooks?
~parinfer-mode-enable-hook~ and ~parinfer-mode-disable-hook~.

** Aggressive-indent, the difference between parinfer-mode and standard Parinfer.
Parinfer-mode use [[https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode][aggressive-indent-mode]] for Paren Mode. 

This means in Paren Mode, the indentation of your code will be handled automatically instead of 'parinfer preserve indentations'.
Because we already have great indentation rules in Emacs.
In the future, maybe an option for using *aggressive-indent* or *original parinfer Paren Mode*.
